### Setup

- fork and clone
- `cd` into the repo directory
- `gem install pry`


### Instructions

You can start this exercise by running the hash quiz file with `ruby hash_quiz.rb`. This will load up the file and drop you into a pry instance. You will have access to all of the data in the `hash_quiz.rb` file before line 48. You can use the pry instance to test out accessing the `general_assembly` hash variable. Find the answers to each questions at the bottom of the file. Once you are satisfied with your answer, copy and paste it into the `hash_quiz.rb` file in VS Code.
